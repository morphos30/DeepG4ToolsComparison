Dear user,

R was updated from version 3.2.5 to version 3.3.2 on the 01-06-2017. Few libraries from the version 3.2.5 are not available anymore:
    - integrOmics is replaced by mixOmics
    - ncdf is replaced by RNetCDF and ncdf4
    - RPostgreSQL is not available anymore

If you find that a library is missing or you have difficulties to install a particular library (and you will have if you try), please contact support.abims@sb-roscoff.fr

Sincerely,
ABiMS support team
