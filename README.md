## DeepG4ToolsComparison: A snakemake pipeline to run and compare G4 DNA prediction tools with DeepG4

This pipeline generates the results from our paper : [**DeepG4**: A deep
learning approach to predict active
G-quadruplexes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/07/23/2020.07.22.215699).

### Overview

Itâ€™s based on [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
to manage the workflow and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to isolate
the application and run it with the appropriate tool versions.

### Installation

#### Clone the repository :

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/morphos30/DeepG4ToolsComparison.git
cd DeepG4ToolsComparison
```

#### Install the docker image and run it :

``` bash
docker build . -t morphos30/g4docker -f Dockerfile/Dockerfile
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/DeepG4ToolsComparison morphos30/g4docker /bin/bash
```

Where `$(pwd)` is the working directory of `DeepG4ToolsComparison` on
your computer.

#### Launch the pipeline :

``` bash
cd /DeepG4ToolsComparison
snakemake --use-conda -j 30
```

You have to set the option `--use-conda` in order to install and run
each tool in its proper environment.

### Workflow specifications

#### Input

-   DNA sequences into bed format, split into positive set and negative
    set, written into the bed directory.

**Note :** if you want add a new dataset, edit the `Snakefile` file and
add the bed files in the dictionnary `EXPERIMENTS`, without the `.bed`
extension. Example :

`TestSet_Peaks_BG4_G4seq_HaCaT_GSE76688_hg19_201b_Ctrl_gkmSVM_0.8_42_Ctrl_gkmSVM.bed`
`TestSet_Peaks_BG4_G4seq_HaCaT_GSE76688_hg19_201b_Ctrl_gkmSVM_0.8_42.bed`

``` python
EXPERIMENTS = {
  "TestSet_Peaks_BG4_G4seq_HaCaT_GSE76688_hg19_201b_Ctrl_gkmSVM_0.8_42_Ctrl_gkmSVM":{"CTRL":"TestSet_Peaks_BG4_G4seq_HaCaT_GSE76688_hg19_201b_Ctrl_gkmSVM_0.8_42_Ctrl_gkmSVM","EXP":"TestSet_Peaks_BG4_G4seq_HaCaT_GSE76688_hg19_201b_Ctrl_gkmSVM_0.8_42"}
}
```

Where `CTRL` is the negative set and `EXP` is the positive set.

-   DNA Accessibility (ATAC-seq/DNAse-seq/MNase-seq) in bigwig format or
    directly the averaged value for each sequence in a `one-column tsv`
    file.

``` python
ATACFILE = {
    "TestSet_Peaks_BG4_G4seq_HaCaT_GSE76688_hg19_201b_Ctrl_gkmSVM":["ATAC_entinostat_mean.bw"]
}
```

or `one-column tsv` file in
`fasta/{Experiment_name}/{Experiment_name}_atac_merged.tsv`. Example :

`fasta/TestSet_Peaks_BG4_G4seq_HaCaT_GSE76688_hg19_201b_Ctrl_gkmSVM/TestSet_Peaks_BG4_G4seq_HaCaT_GSE76688_hg19_201b_Ctrl_gkmSVM_atac_merged.tsv`
